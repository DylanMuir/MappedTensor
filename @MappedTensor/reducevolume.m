function s = reducevolume(a, R)
% REDUCEVOLUME reduce an array size
%   B = REDUCEVOLUME(A, [Rx Ry Rz ... ]) reduces the number
%     of elements in the object by only keeping every Rx element in the x
%     direction, every Ry element in the y direction, and every Rz element
%     in the z direction and so on.
%     The result is a normal Matlab array.
%
%   B = REDUCEVOLUME(A, R)
%     If a scalar R is used to indicate the amount or
%     reduction instead of a vector, the reduction is assumed to
%     be R on all axes. 
%
%   B = REDUCEVOLUME(A)
%     When omitted, the volume/size reduction is performed on bigger axes until
%     the final array contains less than 1e6 elements.
