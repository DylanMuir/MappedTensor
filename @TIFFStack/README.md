# TIFFStack
Load TIFF files into matlab fast, with lazy loading

This class allows you to access a TIFF file as a matlab tensor, while
only reading the data that you need from disk. A `TIFFStack` object
appears like a four-dimensional tensor, with dimensions for rows,
columns, frames and channels (multiple samples per pixel). These objects
can be passed transparently into other functions that expect matlab
tensors. If you need to process only a portion, or only one channel of a
TIFF stack, then this class will save you allocating the enormous
amounts of memory required to load the entire file. `TIFFStack` is also
much faster than using `imread` to read each frame of the TIFF file
separately.

`TIFFStack` attempts to use `libTiff`, which is directly supported
in recent Matlab versions. This provides dramatic speed-ups, and is a good deal faster than using `imread` or
the Matlab `Tiff` class. If `libTiff` is not available, then Matlab-only
code is used to read image data. `permute`, `ipermute`, `transpose` and
`ctranspose` are also transparently supported.

## Download and install

[Download `TIFFStack`]

 Install `TIFFStack` by unpacking the zip file into a directory called
*@TIFFStack*. The ampersand symbol (@) is important, since it indicates
to [Matlab] that `TIFFStack` is an object-oriented module. Add the parent
directory &mdash; not the *@TIFFStack* directory &mdash; to the [Matlab] path.

## Usage

    tsStack = TIFFStack(strFilename <, bInvert>)

A `TIFFStack` object behaves like a read-only memory mapped TIFF file.
The entire image stack is treated as a matlab tensor. Each frame of the
file must have the same dimensions. Reading the image data is optimised
to the extent possible; the header information is only read once.

This class attempts to use the Matlab tifflib interface, if available.
If not, it uses a modified version of `tiffread` \[1, 2\] to read data.
Code is included (but disabled) to use the matlab imread function, but
this function returns invalid data for some TIFF formats.

## Construction of a `TIFFStack` object

    >> tsStack = TIFFStack('test.tiff'); % Construct a TIFF stack associated with a file

    >> tsStack = TIFFStack('test.tiff', true); % Indicate that the image data should be inverted 
       tsStack = 
         TIFFStack handle 
         Properties: 
            bInvert: 1 
            strFilename: [1x9 char] 
            sImageInfo: [5x1 struct] 
            strDataClass: 'uint16'

## Accessing data

    >> tsStack(:, :, 3); % Retrieve the 3rd frame of the stack, all planes 
    >> tsStack(:, :, 1, 3); % Retrieve the 3rd plane of the 1st frame 
    >> size(tsStack) % Find the size of the stack (rows, cols, frames, planes per pixel)

    ans = 
       128 128 5 1

    >> tsStack(4); % Linear indexing is supported 
    >> tsStack.bInvert = true; % Turn on data inversion

This work uses `tiffread2` from [Francois Nedelec] to access the data in
the TIFF file. [Matlab] includes the ability to read TIFF files in
`imread`, including niceties such as only reading a region of interest
from each frame, but imread is incredibly slow and amazingly buggy (as
of July 2011). TIFFStack uses `tiffread2` in an optimised fashion, by
reading and caching the header information (the image file directories â€”
IFDs). Each frame can then be read directly without re-opening the file
and re-reading the IFDs.
